# Welcome to Quaternity
#### Our vision is to enable consumers to satisfy their cleaning operations needs consciously, transparently and easily through technology.

## Introduction
One of our core SaaS-Solutions aims to automate the way cleaning processes are organized. 
We build service oriented REST APIs which allow business customers to create cleaning plans and organize cleaning activities.

As you continue reading the requirements of this exercise, we like to point out that you're confronted with a real-world scenario, as such we want you to treat this exercise as one. You shall design your software, rest api, code, commits, tests, comments and treat any database design you end up using as you would do in your job.

Your task is now to build a REST API, that allows the creation of a cleaning plans, assignment of cleaning activities to such a plan and subsequently the manipulation of those activities.

You have to figure out which http methods to use, how to configure the routes and how to store the data. 

## Cleaning Plan, Creation Endpoint
This endpoint should allow clients to create a cleaning plan.
The cleaning plan must consist of following attributes:
* A required Title with a max. length of 256 characters. 
* A required customer identification number (=CustomerId), so you shall be able to list all plans of a certain customer. 
* An autogenerated creation date, that identifies the datetime of the created plan.
* An optional description with a max. length of 512 characters.

Example request body:
```
{ 
   "title": "Hotel Room Cleaning, double bed",
   "customerId": 123223,
   "description": "This plan is meant to be used for double bed rooms."
}
```
The endpoint must validate the provided data and also respond with adequate http status codes.
If cleaning plans are successfully created, An expected response should contain the provided data, the Id and the creation date.

Example response body:
```
{
   "id": "8c442581-c67a-41e5-8d2d-b1176de31087"
   "title": "Hotel Room Cleaning, double bed",
   "customerId": 123223,
   "description": "This plan is meant to be used for double bed rooms.",
   "createdAt" : "2022-01-01T23:00:00Z"
}
```



## Cleaning Plan, List all cleaningplans
This endpoint should provide a list of all cleaningplans using a provided CustomerId. 

Example response body:
```
[
  {
    "id": "8c442581-c67a-41e5-8d2d-b1176de31087"
    "title": "Hotel Room Cleaning, double bed",
    "customerId": 123223,
    "description": "This plan is meant to be used for double bed rooms.",
    "createdAt" : "2022-01-01T23:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "8c442581-c67a-41e5-8d2d-b1176de31087"
    "title": "Mall Cleaning, inner city",
    "customerId": 123223,
    "description": "Suitable only for malls smaller than 23000 mÂ².",
    "createdAt" : "2022-01-02T23:12:22Z"
  }, 
  ...
]
```

## Endpoints
In summary you shall design and write a REST API, which has at least following endpoints:
* Endpoint for creating a cleaning plan for a certain customer
* Endpoint that lists all cleaning plans of a certain customer
* Endpoint that provides a single cleaning plan by its cleaning plan id.
* Endpoint that deletes a cleaning plan and its consequent activities, except those that are 'done'
