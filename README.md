# Welcome to NOUS

## Introduction
One of our core SaaS-Solutions aims to automate the way cleaning processes are organized. 
We build service oriented REST APIs, which allow customers to create cleaning plans.

As you continue reading the requirements of this exercise, we like to point out that we expect you to treat this exercise as a real world exercise. You shall design your software, rest api, code, commits, tests, comments and treat any database design you end up using as you would do in your job.

Your task is to build a REST API, that allows the creation of a cleaning plans subsequently the manipulation of those.

You have to figure out which http methods to use, how to configure the routes and how to store the data. 

The provided project is already preconfigured and contains a setup that can be used. 
You are expected to use asp.net core 5.0, entityframework core 5.0 and therefore store your data in a database.
You can reuse the DbContext in `CleaningManagement.DAL\CleaningManagementDbContext.cs` that uses an in memory database, but you're allowed to use a different setup if prefered

## Cleaning Plan, Creation Endpoint
This endpoint should allow clients to create a cleaning plan.
The cleaning plan must consist of following attributes:
* A required Title with a max. length of 256 characters. 
* A required customer identification number (=CustomerId), so you shall be able to list all plans of a certain customer. 
* An autogenerated creation date, that identifies the datetime of the created plan.
* An optional description with a max. length of 512 characters.

Example request body:
```
{ 
   "title": "Hotel Room Cleaning, double bed",
   "customerId": 123223,
   "description": "This plan is meant to be used for double bed rooms."
}
```
The endpoint must validate the provided data and also respond with adequate http status codes.
If cleaning plans are successfully created, An expected response should contain the provided data, the Id and the creation date.

Example response body:
```
{
   "id": "8c442581-c67a-41e5-8d2d-b1176de31087"
   "title": "Hotel Room Cleaning, double bed",
   "customerId": 123223,
   "description": "This plan is meant to be used for double bed rooms.",
   "createdAt" : "2022-01-01T23:00:00Z"
}
```



## Cleaning Plan, List all cleaningplans
This endpoint should provide a list of all cleaningplans using a provided CustomerId. 

Example response body:
```
[
  {
    "id": "8c442581-c67a-41e5-8d2d-b1176de31087"
    "title": "Hotel Room Cleaning, double bed",
    "customerId": 123223,
    "description": "This plan is meant to be used for double bed rooms.",
    "createdAt" : "2022-01-01T23:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "8c442581-c67a-41e5-8d2d-b1176de31087"
    "title": "Mall Cleaning, inner city",
    "customerId": 123223,
    "description": "Suitable only for malls smaller than 23000 mÂ².",
    "createdAt" : "2022-01-02T23:12:22Z"
  }, 
  ...
]
```

## Endpoints
In summary you shall design and write a REST API, which has at least following endpoints:
* Endpoint for creating a cleaning plan for a certain customer
* Endpoint that lists all cleaning plans of a certain customer
* Endpoint that provides a single cleaning plan by its cleaning plan id.
* Endpoint that deletes a cleaning plan and its consequent activities, except those that are 'done'
